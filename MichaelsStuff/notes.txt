heuristic: (int)(arraypos/n) + 1
 
   based on what value is uncovered, check where the value of a small disk should be based on the large disk value.
   ex. 
       positions:  0 1 2 3 4 
       large:      1 2 3 1 2
       small:      2 1 1 2 0
       solution:   1 1 2 2 0
       
       given position 0, 0/(n = 2) + 1 = [1] then move right

       if the numbers positive, move right based on large number
       if the number is negative, move right based on large number
       if number is 0, dont move (special case solve later)

       thus: 	  
			 step: [2] 1 [1] 2 0 = [1] 1 [2] 2 0
